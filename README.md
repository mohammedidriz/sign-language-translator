# Sign Language Voice Assistant 🖐️🔊

A web-based tool that uses Computer Vision to detect hand signs and convert them into spoken words in real-time.

## 🛠️ How it Works
This project utilizes the **MediaPipe Hands** model to track 21 hand landmarks. 
By calculating the relative positions of fingertips to knuckles, the app identifies specific signs and uses the **Web Speech API** to provide audio output.



## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome/Edge).
2. Allow camera permissions.
3. Start signing!

## 📜 Supported Signs
